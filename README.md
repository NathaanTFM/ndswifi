attempt to use nds wifi driver

For now, this repo is honestly unusable garbage ; it's an attempt to use the [arm7decomp WiFi driver](https://github.com/NathaanTFM/arm7decomp) without modifying it - or at least, with only a few modifications.

There will be attempts to communicate with DS Download Play or Pictochat.
